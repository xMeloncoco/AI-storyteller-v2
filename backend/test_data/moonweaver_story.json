  "initial_message": "The letter arrived on the night of the full moon, just as Master Silvara had predicted.\n\nYou sit in your small room above the apothecary, the envelope trembling slightly in your hands. The seal is pressed with silver wax - a crescent moon wrapped in starlight. You've seen this symbol before, in the old books your grandmother used to show you before she passed. The symbol of the Moonweavers.\n\nYour heart pounds as you break the seal and unfold the parchment inside. The words seem to shimmer faintly in the moonlight streaming through your window.\n\n\"To the one who dreams of silver threads,\n\nYour power has awakened. The patterns you see in the moonlight, the way the shadows bend to your will - these are not imaginings. They are gifts, and dangerous ones if left untrained.\n\nI am Master Silvara of the Moonweaver's Guild. I have watched you from afar and seen your potential. If you wish to understand your abilities, to control them rather than be controlled by them, come to the old tower at the edge of Whisperwood at midnight.\n\nThe choice is yours. But know this - power untrained is power unleashed, and the consequences can be... severe.\n\nMay the moon guide your path.\"\n\nYou look out your window at the full moon hanging heavy in the sky. The old tower. You know the one - people say it's haunted, abandoned for decades. But now you wonder if that was ever true.\n\nThe clock strikes eleven. You have one hour to decide.",
