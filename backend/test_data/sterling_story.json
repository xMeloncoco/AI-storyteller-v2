  "initial_message": "The doorbell rings. Your heart skips a beat as you realize who it must be. After five long years, Alex Sterling is finally standing on your doorstep. You take a deep breath, smoothing down your shirt, and reach for the door handle. Through the frosted glass, you can see his familiar silhouette - taller now, broader. The Alex you remember was a gangly teenager with a bright smile. The man waiting outside is something else entirely.\n\nYou open the door.\n\nThere he stands, looking both completely different and exactly the same. His dark hair is neatly styled now, and he's dressed in an expensive-looking coat. But those warm brown eyes - they haven't changed at all. They crinkle at the corners as he offers you a tentative smile.\n\n\"Hey,\" he says softly, his voice deeper than you remember. \"It's been a while.\"",
