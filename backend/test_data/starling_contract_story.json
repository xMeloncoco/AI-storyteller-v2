  "description": "Two childhood friends, separated by tragedy and family interference, are thrust back together when a decades-old marriage contract becomes their only salvation from financial and legal ruin. What starts as bitter resentment evolves into rediscovered friendship as they navigate corporate sabotage, family expectations, and their own wounded hearts.",
  "initial_message": "The Sterling Enterprises boardroom had never felt more like a battlefield.\n\nFifteen years. That's how long it had been since Miriam Cross and Alexander Sterling had seen each other, and the circumstances of their reunion couldn't have been more brutal. What started as a routine legal meeting had exploded into something far more complex when David Sterling, Alex's uncle and board member, dropped a bombshell that changed everything.\n\nThe marriage contract. Signed when both were barely five years old, buried in legal documents for decades, suddenly their only salvation.\n\nFor Miriam, the revelation came through her mother's trust fund lawyers - she owned 15% of Cross Industries whether she knew it or not, inherited from the mother she'd lost at eight. The company's impending bankruptcy wasn't just about her estranged father anymore; it would destroy her mother's charitable foundation, ruin thousands of loyal employees, and potentially drag Miriam's own assets down with it. The merger through marriage was the only legal mechanism that could save everything she'd unknowingly inherited and everything her mother had built.\n\nFor Alex, his parents had finally found the perfect weapon. Years of reckless behavior, public scandals, and deliberate corporate negligence had pushed them to their breaking point. Marriage to Miriam - with its built-in responsibility of managing the merged companies - or complete disinheritance. No more trust fund, no more position at Sterling Enterprises, no more safety net.\n\nNeither had a choice. Neither wanted this. And both blamed the other for the trap they found themselves in.\n\nThe lawyers had been dismissed an hour ago, leaving only Miriam and Alex in the sterile conference room, surrounded by contracts, financial reports, and the wreckage of their childhood friendship. The shouting match that followed had been legendary - fifteen years of hurt, abandonment, and resentment poured out in accusations and bitter truths. She'd called him a spoiled, worthless playboy who'd never worked a day in his life. He'd called her a cold, calculating bitch who'd forgotten where she came from.\n\nBut eventually, the rage burned itself out, leaving only exhausted resignation and the harsh reality of their situation. One month. That's what the contract required – one month of engagement, cohabitation, and public appearances before the wedding that would merge their families' empires.\n\nOne month of pretending they could stand each other.\n\nThe media had already caught wind of the story. \"Childhood Sweethearts Reunite\" the headlines would read, completely missing the bitter irony. They'd need to play the part of a couple rediscovering love, when in reality they were two wounded people bound together by legal necessity and mutual resentment.\n\nWhich brought them to tonight. Their first public appearance as an \"engaged couple\" - dinner at The Metropolitan Club, where New York's elite would gather to witness the Sterling heir finally settling down with his childhood friend. The restaurant was already buzzing with anticipation, photographers positioned outside, society reporters sharpening their claws.\n\nAlex had suggested they meet at the restaurant - probably hoping to avoid any private conversation beforehand. But Miriam knew better than to give him that advantage. She'd insisted he pick her up properly, play the gentleman for their audience.\n\nNow, as the elevator climbed toward her penthouse apartment, Miriam checked her reflection one final time. The black silk dress was elegant but not trying too hard, her makeup flawless but understated. She looked like what she was - a successful woman who didn't need a man's money or status.\n\nThe doorbell rang at exactly eight o'clock. Punctual, at least some things hadn't changed.\n\nMiriam took a breath, steeled herself for whatever version of Alexander Sterling waited on the other side of her door, and reached for the handle...",
